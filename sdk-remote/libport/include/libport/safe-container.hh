  /** Container wrapper providing iteration robust to removal of any element.
   *
   * To function properly, only a subset of container operations are
   * supported, and incrementing a copy of an iterator different than
   * begin() is not allowed. Furthermore, the number of iterators to
   * not-the-end that can be present at the same time is limited (to at
   * least 32).
   *
   * Usage is simple: Instantiate with container type C (std::list)
   * and element type T. Obtain an iterator by calling begin(). Each
   * call to operator++() on the iterator will give you access to the
   * next element that was present at the time of the begin()
   * call. The call to erase() invalidates *no* iterator (with the
   * exception that you must not try to dereference iterators to
   * removed elements).
   *
   * This implementation is *not* thread-safe.
   *
   * Support for const_iterators is incomplete (we actually return
   * iterators).

     * iterator passed through it. Each iterator is associated with a bit
     * number, and transition direction (from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0).
     * getFlag() is used to retreive an unused bit number. Transition direction
     * is reversed each time the same bit is reused.
     * When iterator++ is called, the iterator looks for the next element with
     * its bit in the 'before transition' state, switches it and returns it.
     * Any call to erase() marks all iterators as dirty. When this happens,
     * next call to iterator++ will look for the first element with its
     * bit in the 'before transition' state, starting from begin().
     * New elements are inserted with all mask bits in the 'after transition'
     * value, so that they are ignored by currently existing iterators.
     * Destruction of an iterator will force it to iterate to the end, so
     * that no initialization is required when another iterator will reuse
     * the same bit.
     * The iterator mark his bit as unused as soon as it reaches end.
     * Making a copy of an iterator equals to begin() will give the copy a
     * new bit number. Making a copy of an iterator being neither begin() nor
     * end() will create an iterator on which ++ cannot be called.
