  abstract =	 {Dynamic programming allows locally optimal
                  instruction selection for expression trees. More
                  importantly, the algorithm allows concise and
                  elegant specification of code generators. Aho,
                  Ganapathi, and Tjiang have built the Twig
                  code-generator-generator, which produces
                  dynamic-programming code-generators from
                  grammar-like specifications.  Encoding a complex
                  architecture as a grammar for a dynamic-programming
                  codegenerator -generator shows the expressive power
                  of the technique. Each instruction, addressing mode,
                  register and class can be expressed individually in
                  the grammar. The grammar can be factored much more
                  readily than with the Graham-Glanville LR(1)
                  algorithm, so it can be much more concise. Twig
                  specifications for the VAX and MC68020 are
                  described, and the corresponding code generators
                  select very good (and under the right assumptions,
                  optimal) instruction sequences.  Limitations and
                  possible improvements to the specification language
                  are discussed.},

                  are common in compiler design courses, but even a
                  small compiler can be daunting to students with no
                  prior compiler-writing experience. When I recently
                  taught compiler design, I developed a very small
                  language with a highly modular compiler, focusing
                  the project on implementing the core parts of a
                  compiler without requiring students to build all the
                  infrastructure from scratch. This paper describes
                  the language and its compiler, and their successes
                  (and occasional limitations) for teaching compiler
                  design.},

  abstract =	 {The broadening of computer science education has
                  called into question the roles of many traditional
                  core courses. In order to remain viable, courses
                  such as compiler construction must provide a
                  coherent view of their subject matter that fits with
                  the rest of the institution's curriculum. Three
                  strategies have evolved for this course. As
                  described in this paper, each strategy provides a
                  model that a professor can use to design an
                  appropriate course for their situation.},

  abstract =	 {SmallEiffel is an Eiffel compiler which uses a fast
                  simple inference mechanism to remove most last
                  binding calls, replacing them by static
                  bindings. Starting from the system's entry point, it
                  compiles only statically living code, which saves
                  compiling and then removing dead code. As the whole
                  system is analyzed at compile time, multiple
                  inheritance and genericity do not cause any
                  overhead.  SmallEiffel features a coding scheme
                  which eliminates the need for virtual function
                  tables. Dynamic dispatch is implemented without any
                  array access but uses a simple static binary branch
                  code. We show that this implementation makes it
                  possible to use modern hardware very efficiently. It
                  also allows to inline more calls even when dynamic
                  dispatch is required. Some more dispatch sites are
                  removed after the type inference algorithm has been
                  performed, if the different branches of a dispatch
                  site lead to the same code.  The advantage of this
                  approach is that it greatly speeds up execution time
                  and considerably decreases the amount of generated
                  code. }
