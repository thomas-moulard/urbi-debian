  abstract =     {This paper describes the Player/Stage software tools
                  applied to multi-robot, distributed-robot and sensor
                  network systems. Player is a robot device server
                  that provides network transparent robot
                  control. Player seeks to constrain controller design
                  as little as possible; it is device independent,
                  non-locking and language- and style-neutral. Stage
                  is a lightweight, highly configurable robot
                  simulator that supports large
                  populations. Player/Stage is a community Free
                  Software project. Current usage of Player and Stage
                  is reviewed, and some interesting research
                  opportunities opened up by this infrastructure are
                  identified.},

  abstract =     {We seek to make robot programming more efficient by
                  developing a standard abstract interface for robot
                  hardware, based on familiar techniques from
                  operating systems and network engineering. This
                  paper describes the application of three well known
                  abstractions, the character device model, the
                  interface/driver model, and the client/server model
                  to this purpose. These abstractions underlie
                  Player/Stage, our Open Source project for rapid
                  development of robot control systems. One product of
                  this project is the Player Abstract Device Interface
                  (PADI) specification, which defines a set of
                  interfaces that capture the functionality of
                  logically similar sensors and actuators. This
                  specification is the central abstraction that
                  enables Player-based controllers to run unchanged on
                  a variety of real and simulated devices. We propose
                  that PADI could be a starting point for development
                  of a standard platform for robot interfacing,
                  independent of Player, to enable code portability
                  and re-use, while still providing access to the
                  unique capabilities of individual devices.}
