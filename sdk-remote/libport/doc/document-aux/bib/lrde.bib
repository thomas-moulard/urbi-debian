		  the first of the two viewing stage operations: required

		  We propose a classification, extending the existing

		  only required elements (culling), and keeping only required
		  details (which includes traditional LODs). The mechanisms
		  needed for display scalability are presented.}

		  program in compilers and language processing tools. Many of
		  the tasks of these tools consist in generating and
		  rewriting ASTs. Such an approach can become tedious and
		  hard to maintain for complex operations, namely program
		  transformation, optimization, instrumentation, etc. On the
		  other hand, \emph{concrete syntax} provides a natural and
		  simpler representation of programs, but it is not usually
		  available as a direct feature of the aforementioned tools.
		  We propose a simple technique to implement AST generation
		  and rewriting in general purpose languages using concrete
		  syntax. Our approach relies on extensions made in the
		  scanner and the parser and the use of objects supporting
		  partial parsing called Text With Embedded Abstract Syntax
		  Trees (TWEASTS). A compiler for a simple language (Tiger)
		  written in \Cxx serves as an example, featuring

		  Other libraries, such as Khoros [Kon94] have a different

  abstract	= {Video games and simulators commonly use very detailed
		  textures, whose cumulative size is often larger than the
		  GPU memory. Textures may be loaded progressively, but
		  dynamically loading and transferring this large amount of
		  data in GPU memory results in loading delays and poor
		  performance. Therefore, managing texture memory has become
		  an important issue. While this problem has been (partly)
		  addressed early for the specific case of terrain rendering,
		  there is no generic texture management system for arbitrary
		  meshes. We propose such a system, implemented on today's
		  GPUs, which unifies classical solutions aimed at reducing
		  memory transfer: progressive loading, texture compression,
		  and caching strategies. For this, we introduce a new
		  algorithm -- running on GPU -- to solve the major
		  difficulty of detecting which parts of the texture are
		  required for rendering. Our system is based on three
		  components manipulating a tile pool which stores texture
		  data in GPU memory. First, the Texture Load Map determines
		  at every frame the appropriate list of texture tiles (i.e.
		  location and MIP-map level) to render from the current
		  viewpoint. Second, the Texture Cache manages the tile pool.
		  Finally, the Texture Producer loads and decodes required
		  texture tiles asynchronously in the tile pool. Decoding of
		  compressed texture data is implemented on GPU to minimize
		  texture transfer. The Texture Producer can also generate
		  procedural textures. Our system is transparent to the user,
		  and the only parameter that must be supplied at runtime is
		  the current viewpoint. No modifications of the mesh are
		  required. We demonstrate our system on large scenes
		  displayed in real time. We show that it achieves
		  interactive frame rates even in low-memory low-bandwidth
		  situations.}

  abstract	= {In this paper we propose a novel approach for color image
		  segmentation. Our approach is based on segmentation of
		  subsets of bands using mathematical morphology followed by
		  the fusion of the resulting segmentation channels. For
		  color images the band subsets are chosen as RG, RB and GB
		  pairs, whose 2D histograms are processed as projections of
		  a 3D histogram. The segmentations in 2D color spaces are
		  obtained using the watershed algorithm. These 2D
		  segmentations are then combined to obtain a final result
		  using a region split-and-merge process. The CIE L a b color
		  space is used to measure the color distance. Our approach
		  results in improved performance and can be generalized for
		  multi-band segmentation of images such as multi-spectral
		  satellite images information.}
