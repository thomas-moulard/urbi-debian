  abstract =     {This paper defends the revival of coroutines as a
                  general control abstraction. After proposing a new
                  classification of coroutines, we introduce the
                  concept of full asymmetric coroutines and provide a
                  precise definition for it through an operational
                  semantics. We then demonstrate that full corou-
                  tines have an expressive power equivalent to
                  one-shot continuations and one- shot partial
                  continuations. We also show that full asymmetric
                  coroutines and one-shot partial continuations have
                  many similarities, and therefore present comparable
                  benefits. Nevertheless, coroutines are easier
                  implemented and understood, specially in the realm
                  of procedural languages. Finally, we pro- vide a
                  collection of programming examples that illustrate
                  the use of full asymmetric coroutines to support
                  direct and concise implementations of several useful
                  control behaviors, including cooperative
                  multitasking.}
