                  transmission problem on such a framework can be considered
                  as a variant of the classical percolation problem. We also
                  present an adaptive stochastic routing algorithm protect
                  from inevitable eavesdroppers.  Simulations were carried
                  out not only to validate our approach, but also to compute
                  critical parameters ensuring security.  These results show
                  that large quantum networks with eavesdroppers do provide
                  security.},
