  abstract =     {Predicate classes are a new linguistic construct
                  designed to complement normal classes in
                  object-oriented languages. Like a normal class, a
                  predicate class has a set of superclasses, methods,
                  and instance variables. However, unlike a normal
                  class, an object is automatically an instance of a
                  predicate class whenever it satisfies a predicate
                  expression associated with the predicate class. The
                  predicate expression can test the value or state of
                  the object, thus supporting a form of implicit
                  property-based classification that augments the
                  explicit type-based classification provided by
                  normal classes. By associating methods with
                  predicate classes, method lookup can depend not only
                  on the dynamic class of an argument but also on its
                  dynamic value or state. If an object is modified,
                  the property-based classification of an object can
                  change over time, implementing shifts in major
                  behavior modes of the object. A version of predicate
                  classes has been designed and implemented in the
                  context of the Cecil language.},
