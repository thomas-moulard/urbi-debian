  abstract =     {We present a parallel generational-copying garbage
                  collector implemented for the Glasgow Haskell
                  Compiler. We use a block-structured memory
                  allocator, which provides a natural granularity for
                  dividing the work of GC between many threads,
                  leading to a simple yet effective method for
                  parallelising copying GC. The results are
                  encouraging: we demonstrate wall-clock speedups of
                  on average a factor of 2 in GC time on a commodity
                  4-core machine with no programmer intervention,
                  compared to our best sequential GC.},
