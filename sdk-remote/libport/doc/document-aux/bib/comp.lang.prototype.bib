  abstract =     {The Smalltalk-80 system offers a language with a
                  small and elegant conceptual core, and a highly
                  interactive programming environment. We believe,
                  however, that it could be made more learnable and
                  usable by a relatively small set of changes. In this
                  paper, we present the results of a series of
                  empirical studies on learnability, and also some
                  informal studies of large implementation pro
                  jects. Based on these studies, we suggest a number
                  of changes to the Smalltalk-80 language and system.},
