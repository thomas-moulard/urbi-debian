  /// Pure virtual class for a client connection.

  /*! UConnection is holding the message queue in and out. No
     assumption is made here on the kind of underlying connection
     (TCP, IPC, ...).

     The sending mechanism is asynchronous. Each time the send()
     function is called, it will pile the data in the internal buffer
     and try to send what is available in the internal buffer by
     calling continue_send(), except if the connection is blocked (see
     block()).

     The programmer has to call continue_send() each time the system
     is ready to send something, to make sure the internal buffer is
     progressively emptied.

     If the connection is not ready for sending, the programmer must
     call the block() function in order to prevent future send() to
     call continue_send().  Using this feature, it is always possible
     to use send(), but the data will simply be piled on the internal
     buffer and sent later, when the connection is unblocked.

     A call to continue_send() automatically unblocks the
     connection.

     The received() function must be called each time data has been
     received on the connection.

     The effective_send() function should be overloaded to define
     the way the system is actually sending data through the real
     connection.  */
