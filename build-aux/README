This directory holds all the Autoconf/Automake (and maybe scripts) we
rely on in several projects.

Please, do not install standard files that are installed by the
bootstrapping script, such as config.guess, install-sh, ltmain.sh etc.
They should be svn:ignored.

Do add an Makefile.am either: it is the top-level Makefile which
should ship these files, for instance

       EXTRA_DIST = build-aux/bootstrap

But it should not be needed: Automake automatically ships included
Makefile snippets, and Autoconf M4 bits.

* Makefile snippets

** build-aux.mk
Provides convenient targets wrapping build-aux and libport handling.

*** EXTERNAL-up
Update EXTERNAL to the most recent version, and pin it.

*** EXTERNAL-pin
Subscribe to the most recent version.

*** EXTERNAL-ci
You made modification in EXTERNAL.  So check them in, then run the
corresponding EXTERNAL-up.

*** recheck
Unrelated to the previous targets: just relaunches configure and make
again (in case something changed in the environment).  Named after
./config.status --recheck.

** init.mk
Initializes some Automake variables so that we can always use += on them.

** revision.mk, version.hh.in
This is used to insert Subversion keywords in the programs, in the
banners for instance.

To use this module, insert something like this in your Makefile.am:

   REVISION_FILE = version.hh
   include $(top_srcdir)/build-aux/revision.mk

since it extends (using +=), BUILT_SOURCES, EXTRA_DIST and CLEANFILES,
they should be defined before the include.

** config-headers-prefixed.mk.
See URBI_CONFIG_HEADERS_PREFIXED.  It is obsoleted, it is too painful
to use correctly.  It is simpler and safer to do it from the Makefile
than from both config.status and the Makefile.  See how
include/libport/libport.mk does.

** qtestlib.mk
Test environment to run Qt unit test.

* Scripts

** emacsen-qtestlib.rb
Make Qt unit test output, Emacs comptible.

* Autoconf extensions
** urbi-build-aux.m4
URBI_BUILD_AUX.  Should be called by users of build-aux.mk.

** urbi-config-headers-prefixed.m4
To prefix config.h with a given symbol.  Very useful when one wants to
install a config.h, as otherwise there will be conflicts with other
config.h.  See also urbi-config-headers-prefixed.mk.

** enable-emacs-output.m4
Add --enable-emacs-output. Useful for Emacs compatible output of Qt unit test
system.

* Miscelaneous

** rebox.el
An Emacs file to build nice comment boxes
