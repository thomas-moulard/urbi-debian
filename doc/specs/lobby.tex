\section{Lobby}

A \dfn{lobby} is the local environment for each (remote or local)
connection to an \urbi server.

\subsection{Prototypes}
\begin{itemize}
\item \refSlot[Channel]{topLevel}, an instance of \refObject{Channel}
  with an empty Channel name.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Construction}

A lobby is implicitly created at each connection. At the top level,
\this is a \dfn{Lobby}.

\begin{urbiscript}
this.protos;
[00000001] [Lobby]
this.protos[0].protos;
[00000003] [Channel_0xADDR]
\end{urbiscript}

Lobbies cannot be cloned, they must be created using \refSlot{create}.

\begin{urbiscript}
Lobby.new;
[00000177:error] !!! new: `Lobby' objects cannot be cloned
Lobby.create;
[00000174] Lobby_0x126450
\end{urbiscript}


\subsection{Examples}

Since every lobby is-a \refObject{Channel}, one can use the methods of
Channel.

\begin{urbiscript}
lobby << 123;
[00478679] 123
lobby << "foo";
[00478679] "foo"
\end{urbiscript}

\subsection{Slots}
\begin{urbiscriptapi}
\item[authors] Credit the authors of \usdk.

\item[banner] Internal.  Display \usdk banner.
\begin{urbiscript}
lobby.banner;

\end{urbiscript}

\item[connected]
  Whether \this is connected.
\begin{urbiassert}
connected;
\end{urbiassert}

\item[connectionTag] The tag of all code executed in the context of \this.
  This tag applies to \this, but the top-level loop is immune to
  \refSlot[Tag]{stop}, therefore \lstinline|connectionTag| controls every
  thing that was launched from this lobby, yet the lobby itself is still
  usable.
\begin{urbiscript}
every (1s) echo(1), sleep(0.5s); every (1s) echo(2),
sleep(1.2s);
connectionTag.stop;
[00000507] *** 1
[00001008] *** 2
[00001507] *** 1
[00002008] *** 2

"We are alive!";
[00002008] "We are alive!"

every (1s) echo(3), sleep(0.5s); every (1s) echo(4),
sleep(1.2s);
connectionTag.stop;
[00003208] *** 3
[00003710] *** 4
[00004208] *** 3
[00004710] *** 4

"and kicking!";
[00002008] "and kicking!"
\end{urbiscript}

  Of course, a background job may stop a foreground one.
\begin{urbiscript}
{ sleep(1.2s); connectionTag.stop; },
// Note the `;', this is a foreground statement.
every (1s) echo(5);
[00005008] *** 5
[00005508] *** 5

"bye!";
[00006008] "bye!"
\end{urbiscript}

\end{urbiscript}

\item[create]
  Instantiate a new Lobby.
\begin{urbiassert}
Lobby.create;
\end{urbiassert}

\item[echo](<value>, <channel> = "")%
  Send \lstinline|\var{value}.asString| to \this, prefixed
  by the \refObject{String} \var{channel} name if specified.  This is
  the preferred way to send informative messages (prefixed with
  \samp{***}).
\begin{urbiscript}
lobby.echo("111", "foo");
[00015895:foo] *** 111
lobby.echo(222, "");
[00051909] *** 222
lobby.echo(333);
[00055205] *** 333
\end{urbiscript}

\item[echoEach](<list>, <channel> = "")%
  Apply \lstinline|echo(\var{m}, \var{channel})| for each member \var{m} of
  \var{list}.
\begin{urbiscript}
lobby.echo([1, "2"], "foo");
[00015895:foo] *** [1, "2"]

lobby.echoEach([1, "2"], "foo");
[00015895:foo] *** 1
[00015895:foo] *** 2

lobby.echoEach([], "foo");
\end{urbiscript}

%\item \lstinline|help|\experimental\\
%  Launch the tutorial.

\item[instances]
  A list of the currently alive lobbies.  It contains at least the Lobby
  object itself, and the current \refSlot{lobby}.
\begin{urbiassert}
lobby in Lobby.instances;
Lobby in Lobby.instances;
\end{urbiassert}

\item[license]
  Display the end user license agreement of the \usdk.
\begin{urbiunchecked}
lobby.license;
[00000000] *** END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (1.2)

\end{urbiunchecked}

\item[lobby]
  The lobby of the current connection.  This is typically \this.
\begin{urbiassert}
Lobby.lobby === this;
\end{urbiassert}

  But when several connections are active (e.g., when there are remote
  connections), it can be different from the target of the call.

\begin{urbiscript}
Lobby.create| Lobby.create|;
for (var l : lobbies)
  assert (l.lobby == Lobby.lobby);
\end{urbiscript}

\item[onDisconnect](<lobby>)%
  Event launched when \this has disconnected.

\item[quit] Shut this lobby down, i.e., close the connection.  The
  server is still running, see \refSlot[System]{shutdown} to quit the
  server.

\item[receive](<value>)%
  This is low-level routine.  Pretend the \refObject{String}
  \var{value} was received from the connection.  There is no guarantee
  that \var{value} will be the next program block that will be
  processed: for instance, if you load a file which, in its middle,
  uses \lstinline|lobby.receive("foo")|, then \lstinline|"foo"| will
  be appended after the end of the file.
\begin{urbiscript}
Lobby.create.receive("12;");
[00478679] 12
\end{urbiscript}

\item[remoteIP]
  When \this is connected to a remote server, it's Internet address.

\item[send](<value>, <channel> = "")%
  This is low-level routine.  Send the \refObject{String} \var{value}
  to \this, prefixed by the \refObject{String}
  \var{channel} name if specified.
\begin{urbiscript}
lobby.send("111", "foo");
[00015895:foo] 111
lobby.send("222", "");
[00051909] 222
lobby.send("333");
[00055205] 333
\end{urbiscript}

\item[thanks] Credit the contributors of \usdk.

\item[wall](<value>, <channel> = "")%
  Perform \lstinline|echo(\var{value}, \var{channel})| on all the
  existing lobbies (except Lobby itself).
\begin{urbiscript}[firstnumber=1]
Lobby.wall("111", "foo");
[00015895:foo] *** 111
\end{urbiscript}

\item[write](<value>)%
  This is low-level routine.  Send the \refObject{String} \var{value}
  to the connection.  Note that because of buffering, the output might
  not be visible before an end-of-line character is output.
\begin{urbiscript}
lobby.write("[");
lobby.write("999999999:");
lobby.write("myTag] ");
lobby.write("Hello, World!");
lobby.write("\n");
[999999999:myTag] Hello, World!
