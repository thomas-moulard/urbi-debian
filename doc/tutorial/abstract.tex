\begin{partDescription}{part:tut}
  {%
    This part, also known as the ``\us tutorial'', teaches the reader
    how to program in
    \us.  It goes from the basis to concurrent and
    event-based programming.  No specific knowledge is expected.
    There is no need for a \Cxx compiler, as \UObject will not be
    covered here (see \autoref{part:uobject}).  The reference manual
    contains a terse and complete definition of the \urbi environment
    (\autoref{part:specs}).
