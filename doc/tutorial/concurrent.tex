\chapter{Parallelism, Concurrent Flow Control}
\label{sec:tut:concurrent}

Parallelism is a major feature of \us. So far, all we've
seen already existed in other languages --- although we tried to pick,
mix and adapt features and paradigms to create a nice scripting
language. Parallelism is one of the corner stones of its paradigm, and
what makes it so well suited to high-level scripting of interactive
agents, in fields such as robotics or \ai.

\section{Parallelism operators}

For now, we've separated our different commands with a semicolon
(\lstinline{;}). There are actually four statement separators in \us:

\begin{itemize}
\item ``\lstinline{;}'': Serialization operator. Wait for the left
  operand to finish before continuing.
\item ``\lstinline{&}'': Parallelism n-ary operator. All its operands are
  started simultaneously, and executed in parallel. The \lstinline{&} block
  itself finishes when all the operands have finished. \lstinline{&} has
  higher precedence than other separators.
\item ``\lstinline{,}'': Background operator. Its left operand is started,
  and then it proceeds immediately to its right operand.  This operator is
  bound to scopes: when used inside a scope, the scope itself finishes only
  when all the statements backgrounded with \samp{,} have finished.
\end{itemize}

The example below demonstrates the use of \lstinline{&} to launch two
functions in parallel.

\begin{urbiscript}[firstnumber=1]
function test(name)
{
  echo(name + ": 1");
  echo(name + ": 2");
  echo(name + ": 3");
} |;
// Serialized executions
test("left") ; test ("middle"); test ("right");
[00000000] *** left: 1
[00000000] *** left: 2
[00000000] *** left: 3
[00000000] *** middle: 1
[00000000] *** middle: 2
[00000000] *** middle: 3
[00000000] *** right: 1
[00000000] *** right: 2
[00000000] *** right: 3
// Parallel execution
test("left") & test("middle") & test ("right");
[00000000] *** left: 1
[00000000] *** middle: 1
[00000000] *** right: 1
[00000000] *** left: 2
[00000000] *** middle: 2
[00000000] *** right: 2
[00000000] *** left: 3
[00000000] *** middle: 3
[00000000] *** right: 3
\end{urbiscript}

In this test, we see that the \lstinline{&} runs its operands
simultaneously.

The difference between ``\lstinline{&}'' and ``\lstinline{,}'' is
rather subtle:

\begin{itemize}
\item In the top level, no operand of a job will start ``\lstinline{&}''
  until all are known.  So if you send a line ending with ``\lstinline{&}'',
  the system will wait for the right operand (in fact, it will wait for a
  ``\lstinline{,}'' or a ``\lstinline{;}'') before firing its left operand.
  A statement ending with ``\lstinline{,}'' will be fired immediately.
\item Execution is blocked after a ``\lstinline{&}'' group until all
  its children have finished.
\end{itemize}

\begin{urbiscript}[firstnumber=1]
function test(name)
{
  echo(name + ": 1");
  echo(name + ": 2");
  echo(name + ": 3");
} | {};
// Run test and echo("right") in parallel,
// and wait until both are done before continuing
test("left") & echo("right"); echo("done");
[00000000] *** left: 1
[00000000] *** right
[00000000] *** left: 2
[00000000] *** left: 3
[00000000] *** done
// Run test in background, then both echos without waiting.
test("left") , echo("right"); echo("done");
[00000000] *** left: 1
[00000000] *** right
[00000000] *** left: 2
[00000000] *** done
[00000000] *** left: 3
\end{urbiscript}

That's about all there is to say about these operators. Although
they're rather simple, they are really powerful and enables you to
include parallelism anywhere at no syntactical cost.

\section{Detach}

The \lstindex{Control.detach} function backgrounds the execution of
its argument. Its behavior is the same as the comma (\lstinline{,})
operator, except that the execution is completely detached, and not
waited for at the end of the scope.

\begin{urbiscript}[firstnumber=1]
function test()
{
  // Wait for one second, and echo "foo".
  detach({sleep(1s); echo("foo")});
}|;
test();
echo("Not blocked");
[00000000] Job<shell_4>
[00000000] *** Not blocked
sleep(2s);
echo("End of sleep");
[00001000] *** foo
[00002000] *** End of sleep
\end{urbiscript}

\section{Tags for parallel control flows}
\label{sec:tut:tags}

A \refObject{Tag} is a multipurpose code execution control and instrumentation
feature. Any chunk of code can be tagged, by preceding it with a tag
and a colon (\lstinline{:}). Tag can be created with
\lstinline|Tag.new(\var{name})|.  Naming tags is optional, yet it's
a good idea since it will be used for many features. The example below
illustrates how to tag chunks of code.

\begin{urbiscript}[firstnumber=1]
// Create a new tag
var mytag = Tag.new("name");
[00000000] Tag<name>
// Tag the evaluation of 42
mytag: 42;
[00000000] 42
// Tag the evaluation of a block.
mytag: { "foo"; 51 };
[00000000] 51
// Tag a function call.
mytag: echo("tagged");
[00000000] *** tagged
\end{urbiscript}

You can use tags that were not declared previously, they will be created
implicitly (see below). However, this is not recommended since
tags will be created in a global scope, the \lstinline{Tag} object. This
feature can be used when inputting test code in the top level to avoid
bothering to declare each tag, yet it is considered poor
practice in regular code.

\begin{urbiscript}[firstnumber=1]
// Since mytag is not declared, this will first do:
// var Tag.mytag = Tag.new("mytag");
mytag : 42;
[00000000] 42
\end{urbiscript}

So you can tag code, yet what's the use? One of the primary purpose of
tags is to be able to control the execution of code running in
parallel. Tags have a few control methods (see \refObject{Tag}):

\begin{description}
\item[freeze] Suspend execution of all tagged code.
\item[unfreeze] Resume execution of previously frozen code.
\item[stop] Stop the execution of the tagged code. The flows of
  execution that where stopped jump immediately at the end of the
  tagged block.
\item[block] Block the execution of the tagged code, that is:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Stop it.
  \item When an execution flow encounters the tagged block, it simply
    skips it.
  \end{itemize}
  You can think of \lstinline{block} like a permanent \lstinline{stop}.
\item[unblock] Stop blocking the tagged code.
\end{description}

The three following examples illustrate these features.

\begin{urbiscript}[firstnumber=1]
// Launch in background (using the comma) code that prints "ping"
// every second.  Tag it to keep control over it.
mytag:
  every (1s)
    echo("ping"),
sleep(2.5s);
[00000000] *** ping
[00001000] *** ping
[00002000] *** ping
// Suspend execution
mytag.freeze;
// No printing anymore
sleep(1s);
// Resume execution
mytag.unfreeze;
sleep(1s);
[00007000] *** ping
\end{urbiscript}

\begin{urbiscript}[firstnumber=1]
// Now, we print out a message when we get out of the tag.
{
  mytag:
    every (1s)
      echo("ping");
  // Execution flow jumps here if mytag is stopped.
  echo("Background job stopped")|
},
sleep(2.5s);
[00000000] *** ping
[00001000] *** ping
[00002000] *** ping
// Stop the tag
mytag.stop;
[00002500] *** Background job stopped
// Our background job finished.
// Unfreezing the tag has no effect.
mytag.unfreeze;
\end{urbiscript}

\begin{urbiscript}[firstnumber=1]
// Now, print out a message when we get out of the tag.
loop
{
  echo("ping"); sleep(1s);
  mytag: { echo("pong"); sleep(1s); };
},
sleep(3.5s);
[00000000] *** ping
[00001000] *** pong
[00002000] *** ping
[00003000] *** pong

// Block printing of pong.
mytag.block;
sleep(3s);

// The second half of the while isn't executed anymore.
[00004000] *** ping
[00005000] *** ping
[00006000] *** ping

// Reactivate pong
mytag.unblock;
sleep(3.5s);
[00008000] *** pong
[00009000] *** ping
[00010000] *** pong
[00011000] *** ping
\end{urbiscript}

\section{Advanced example with parallelism and tags}

In this section, we implement a more advanced example with
parallelism.

The listing below presents how to implement a \lstinline{timeOut}
function, that takes code to execute and a timeout as arguments. It
executes the code, and returns its value. However, if the code
execution takes longer than the given timeout, it aborts it, prints
\lstinline|"Timeout!"| and returns \lstinline|void|. In this example, we use:

\begin{itemize}
\item Lazy evaluation, since we want to delay the execution of the
  given code, to keep control on it.
\item Concurrency operators, to launch a timeout job in background.
\end{itemize}

% FIXME: doesn't work (inner return)
\begin{urbiscript}[firstnumber=1]
// timeout (Code, Duration).
function timeOut
{
  // In background, launch a timeout job that waits
  // for the given duration before aborting the function.
  // call.evalArgAt(1) is the second argument, the duration.
  {
    sleep(call.evalArgAt(1));
    echo("Timeout!");
    return;
  },
  // Run the Code and return its value.
  return call.evalArgAt(0);
} |;
timeOut({sleep(1s); echo("On time"); 42}, 2s);
[00000000] *** On time
[00000000] 42
timeOut({sleep(2s); echo("On time"); 42}, 1s);
[00000000] *** Timeout!
\end{urbiscript}
