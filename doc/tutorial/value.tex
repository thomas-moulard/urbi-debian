\chapter{Basic Objects, Value Model}
\label{sec:tut:value}

In this section, we focus on \us values as objects, and study \us
by-reference values model. We won't study classes and actual objective
programming yet, these points will be presented in
\autoref{sec:tut:object}.

\section{Objects in \us}
\label{sec:tut:objects}
An object in \us is a rather simple concept: a list of slots. A
\dfn{slot} is a value associated to a name. So an \dfn{object} is a
list of slot names, each of which indexes a value --- just like a
dictionary.

\begin{urbiscript}[firstnumber=1]
// Create a fresh object with two slots.
class Foo
{
  var a = 42;
  var b = "foo";
};
[00000000] Foo
\end{urbiscript}

The \lstinline{localSlotNames} method lists the names of the slots of
an object (\refObject{Object}).

\begin{urbiscript}
// Inspect it.
Foo.localSlotNames;
[00000000] ["a", "asFoo", "b", "type"]
\end{urbiscript} % fix color $

You can get an object's slot value by using the dot (\lstinline{.})
operator on this object, followed by the name of the slot.

\begin{urbiscript}
// We now know the name of its slots. Let's see their value.
Foo.a;
[00000000] 42
Foo.b;
[00000000] "foo"
\end{urbiscript}

It's as simple as this.  The \lstinline|inspect| method provides a
convenient short-hand to discover an object (\refObject{Object}).

\begin{urbiscript}
Foo.inspect;
[00000009] *** Inspecting Foo
[00000010] *** ** Prototypes:
[00000011] ***   Object
[00000012] *** ** Local Slots:
[00000014] ***   a : Float
[00000015] ***   asFoo : Code
[00000016] ***   b : String
[00000013] ***   type : String
\end{urbiscript} % fix color $

Let's now try to build such an object. First, we want a fresh object
to work on. In \us, \lstinline{Object} is the parent type of every
object (in fact, since \us is prototype-based, \lstinline{Object} is
the uppermost prototype of every object, but we'll talk about
prototypes later). An instance of object, is an empty, neutral object,
so let's start by instantiating one with the \lstinline{clone} method
of \lstinline{Object}.

\begin{urbiscript}
// Create the o variable as a fresh object.
var o = Object.clone;
[00000000] Object_0x00000000
// Check its content
o.inspect;
[00006725] *** Inspecting Object_0x00000000
[00006725] *** ** Prototypes:
[00006726] ***   Object
[00006726] *** ** Local Slots:
\end{urbiscript}

As you can see, we obtain an empty fresh object. Note that it still
inherits from \lstinline{Object} features that all objects share, such as
the \lstinline{localSlotNames} method.

Also note how \lstinline{o} is printed out: \lstinline{Object_},
followed by an hexadecimal number. Since this object is empty, its
printing is quite generic: its type (\lstinline{Object}), and its
unique identifier (every \us object has one). Since these identifiers
are often irrelevant and might differ between two executions, they are
often filled with zeroes in this document.

We're now getting back to our empty object. We want to give it two
slots, \lstinline{a} and \lstinline{b}, with values \lstinline|42| and
\lstinline|"foo"| respectively. We can do this with the
\lstinline{setSlot} method, which takes the slot name and
its value.

\begin{urbiscript}
o.setSlot("a", 42);
[00000000] 42
o.inspect;
[00009837] *** Inspecting Object_0x00000000
[00009837] *** ** Prototypes:
[00009837] ***   Object
[00009838] *** ** Local Slots:
[00009838] ***   a : Float
\end{urbiscript}

Here we successfully created our first slot, \lstinline|a|. A good
shorthand for setting slot is using the \lstinline{var} keyword.

\begin{urbiscript}
// This is equivalent to o.setSlot("b", "foo").
var o.b = "foo";
[00000000] "foo"
o.inspect;
[00072678] *** Inspecting Object_0x00000000
[00072678] *** ** Prototypes:
[00072679] ***   Object
[00072679] *** ** Local Slots:
[00072679] ***   a : Float
[00072680] ***   b : String
\end{urbiscript}

The latter form with \lstinline{var} is preferred, but you need to know
the name of the slot at the time of writing the code. With the former
one, you can compute the slot name at execution time. Likewise, you
can read a slot with a run-time determined name with the
\lstinline{getSlot} method, which takes the slot name as
argument.  The following listing illustrates the use of
\lstinline{getSlot} and \lstinline{setSlot} to read and write slots whose
names are unknown at code-writing time.

% mefyl: FIXME: I never introduced that '+' concatenates strings.

\begin{urbiscript}
function set(object, name, value)
{
  // We have to use setSlot here, since we don't
  // know the actual name of the slot.
  return object.setSlot("x_" + name, value);
} |;
function get(object, name)
{
  // We have to use getSlot here, since we don't
  // know the actual name of the slot.
  return object.getSlot("x_" + name);
} |;
var x = Object.clone;
[00000000] Object_0x00000000
set(x, "foo", 0);
[00000000] 0
set(x, "bar", 1);
[00000000] 1
x.localSlotNames;
[00000000] ["x_bar", "x_foo"]
get(x, "foo");
[00000000] 0
get(x, "bar");
[00000000] 1
\end{urbiscript}

Right, now we can create fresh objects, create slots in them and read
them afterward, even if their name is dynamically computed, with
\lstinline{getSlot} and \lstinline{setSlot}. Now, you might wonder if
there's a method to update the value of the slot. Guess what, there's
one, and it's named\ldots \lstinline{updateSlot} (originality
award). Getting back to our \lstinline{o} object, let's try to update one
of its slots.

\begin{urbiscript}
o.a;
[00000000] 42
o.updateSlot("a", 51);
[00000000] 51
o.a;
[00000000] 51
\end{urbiscript}

Again, there's a shorthand for \lstinline{updateSlot}: operator
\lstinline{=}.

\begin{urbiscript}
o.b;
[00000000] "foo"
// Equivalent to o.updateSlot("b", "bar")
o.b = "bar";
[00000000] "bar"
o.b;
[00000000] "bar"
\end{urbiscript}

Likewise, prefer the '\lstinline{=}' notation whenever
possible, but you'll need \lstinline{updateSlot} to update a slot whose
name you don't know at code-writing time.

Note that defining the same slot twice, be it with \lstinline{setSlot} or
\lstinline{var}, is an error. The slot must be defined once with setSlot,
and subsequent writes must be done with \lstinline{updateSlot}.

\begin{urbiscript}
var o.c = 0;
[00000000] 0
// Can't redefine a slot like this
var o.c = 1;
[00000000:error] !!! slot redefinition: c
// Okay.
o.c = 1;
[00000000] 1
\end{urbiscript}

Finally, use \lstinline{removeSlot} to delete a slot from an object.

\begin{urbiscript}
o.localSlotNames;
[00000000] ["a", "b", "c"]
o.removeSlot("c");
[00000000] Object_0x00000000
o.localSlotNames;
[00000000] ["a", "b"]
\end{urbiscript}

Here we are, now you can inspect and modify objects at will. Don't
hesitate to explore \us objects you'll encounter through this
documentation like this. Last point: reading, updating or removing a
slot which does not exist is, of course, an error.

\begin{urbiscript}
o.d;
[00000000:error] !!! lookup failed: d
o.d = 0;
[00000000:error] !!! lookup failed: d
\end{urbiscript}

\section{Methods}

Methods in \us are simply object slots containing functions. We made a
little simplification earlier by saying that \lstinline|obj.slot| is
equivalent to \lstinline|obj.getSlot("slot")|: if the fetched value is
executable code such as a function, the dot form evaluates it, as
illustrated below. Inside a method, \this gives access to
the target --- as in \Cxx.  It can be omitted if there is no ambiguity
with local variables.

\begin{urbiscript}[firstnumber=1]
var o = Object.clone;
[00000000] Object_0x0
// This syntax stores the function in the 'f' slot of 'o'.
function o.f ()
{
  echo("This is f with target " + this);
  return 42;
} |;
// The slot value is the function.
o.getSlot("f");
[00000001] function () {
[:]  echo("This is f with target ".'+'(this));
[:]  return 42;
[:]}
// Huho, the function is invoked!
o.f;
[00000000] *** This is f with target Object_0x0
[00000000] 42
// The parentheses are in fact optional.
o.f();
[00000000] *** This is f with target Object_0x0
[00000000] 42
\end{urbiscript}

This was designed this way so as one can replace an attribute, such as
an integer, with a function that computes the value. This enables to
replace an attribute with a method without changing the object
interface, since the parentheses are optional.

This implies that \lstinline|getSlot| can be a better tool for object
inspection to avoid invoking slots, as shown below.

\begin{urbiscript}
// The 'empty' method of strings returns whether the string is empty.
"foo".empty;
[00000000] false
"".empty;
[00000000] true
// Using getSlot, we can fetch the function without calling it.
"".getSlot("asList");
[00000000] function () {
[:]  split("")
[:]}
\end{urbiscript}

The \lstinline|asList| function simply bounces the task to
\lstinline|split|.  Let's try \lstinline{getSlot}'ing another method:

\begin{urbiscript}
"foo".size;
[00000000] 3
"foo".getSlot("size");
[00000000] Primitive_0x0
\end{urbiscript}

The \lstinline{size} method of \refObject{String} is another type of
object: a \refObject{Primitive}. These objects are executable, like
functions, but they are actually opaque primitives implemented in
\Cxx.

\section{Everything is an object}

If you're wondering what is an object and what is not, the answer is
simple: every single bit of value you manipulate in \us is an
object, including primitive types, types themselves, functions, \ldots

\begin{urbiscript}
var x = 0;
[00000000] 0
x.localSlotNames;
[00000000] []
var x.slot = 1;
[00000000] 1
x.localSlotNames;
[00000000] ["slot"]
x.slot;
[00000000] 1
x;
[00000000] 0
\end{urbiscript}

% FIXME: I'm saying integer through this whole documentation, even
% though 42 is a float for now. But it will eventually be an integer
% (right? right?).
As you can see, integers are objects just like any other value.

\section{The \us values model}

We are now going to focus on the \us value model, that is how values
are stored and passed around. The whole point is to understand when
variables point to the same object.  For this, we introduce
\lstinline{uid}, a method that returns the target's unique identifier
--- the same one that was printed when we evaluated
\lstinline|Object.clone|.  Since uids might vary from an execution to
another, their values in this documentation are dummy, yet not null to
be able to differentiate them.

\begin{urbiscript}[firstnumber=1]
var o = Object.clone;
[00000000] Object_0x100000
o.uid;
[00000000] "0x100000"
42.uid;
[00000000] "0x200000"
42.uid;
[00000000] "0x300000"
\end{urbiscript}

% FIXME: maybe should I introduce == and other basic operator before.
Our objects have different uids, reflecting the fact that they are
different objects. Note that entering the same integer twice
(\lstinline{42} here) yields different objects. Let's introduce new
operators before diving in this concept. First the equality operator:
\lstinline{==}. This operator is the exact same as \C or \Cxx's one,
it simply returns whether its two operands are \emph{semantically}
equal. The second operator is \lstinline{===}, which is the
\emph{physical} equality operator. It returns whether its two operands
are the same object, which is equivalent to having the same uid. This
can seem a bit confusing; let's have an example.

\begin{urbiscript}
var a = 42;
[00000000] 42
var b = 42;
[00000000] 42
a == b;
[00000000] true
a === b;
[00000000] false
\end{urbiscript}

Here, the \lstinline{==} operator reports that \lstinline{a} and
\lstinline{b} are equal ---
indeed, they both evaluate to 42. Yet, the \lstinline{===} operator shows
that they are not the same object: they are two different
instances of integer objects, both equal 42.

Thanks to this operator, we can point out the fact that slots and
local variables in \us have a reference semantic. That is, when you
defining a local variable or a slot, you're not copying any value (as
you would be in \C or \Cxx), you're only making it refer to an already
existing value (as you would in \ruby or \java).

\begin{urbiscript}[firstnumber=1]
var a = 42;
[00000000] 42
var b = 42;
[00000000] 42
var c = a; // c refers to the same object as a.
[00000000] 42
// a, b and c are equal: they have the same value.
a == b && a == c;
[00000000] true
// Yet only a and c are actually the same object.
a === b;
[00000000] false
a === c;
[00000000] true
\end{urbiscript}

So here we see that \lstinline|a| and \lstinline|c| point to the same
integer, while \lstinline|b| points to a second one. This a
non-trivial fact: any modification on \lstinline|a| will affect
\lstinline|c| as well, as shown below.

\begin{urbiscript}
a.localSlotNames;
[00000000] []
b.localSlotNames;
[00000000] []
c.localSlotNames;
[00000000] []
var a.flag; // Create a slot in a.
a.localSlotNames;
[00000000] ["flag"]
b.localSlotNames;
[00000000] []
c.localSlotNames;
[00000000] ["flag"]
\end{urbiscript}

Updating slots or local variables does not update the referenced
value. It simply redirects the variable to the new given value.

\begin{urbiscript}[firstnumber=1]
var a = 42;
[00000000] 42
var b = a;
[00000000] 42
// b and a point to the same integer.
a === b;
[00000000] true
// Updating b won't change the referred value, 42,
// it makes it reference a fresh integer with value 51.
b = 51;
[00000000] 51
// Thus, a is left unchanged:
a;
[00000000] 42
\end{urbiscript}

Understanding the two latter examples is really important, to be aware
of what your variable are referring to.

Finally, function and method arguments are also passed by reference:
they can be modified by the function.

\begin{urbiscript}[firstnumber=1]
function test(arg)
{
  var arg.flag;  // add a slot in arg
  echo(arg.uid); // print its uid
} |;
var x = Object.clone;
[00000000] Object_0x1
x.uid;
[00000000] "0x1"
test(x);
[00000000] *** 0x1
x.localSlotNames;
[00000000] ["flag"]
\end{urbiscript}

Beware however that arguments are passed by reference, and the
behavior might not be what you may expected.

\begin{urbiscript}[firstnumber=1]
function test(arg)
{
  // Updates the local variable arg to refer 1.
  // Does not affect the referred value, nor the actual external argument.
  arg = 1;
} |;
var x = 0;
[00000000] 0
test(x);
[00000000] 1
// x wasn't modified
x;
[00000000] 0
\end{urbiscript}

\section{Conclusion}

You should now understand the reference semantic of local variables,
slots and arguments. It's very important to keep them in mind,
otherwise you will end up modifying variables you didn't want, or
change a copy of reference, failing to update the desired one.
