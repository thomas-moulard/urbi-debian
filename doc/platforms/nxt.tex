\chapter{Mindstorms NXT}
\label{sec:nxt}
\setHtmlFileName{nxt}

This documentation contains information about the LEGO Mindstorms NXT
\urbi engine.  The first two chapters provide a short tutorial for
using \urbi to control the TriBot robot.  The remainder of the
documentation contains an exhaustive reference for the LEGO Mindstorms
NXT \urbi engine devices.

\section{Launching \urbi for Mindstorms NXT}

First you should build the TriBot model from the LEGO Mindstorms NXT basic
model.

Install the engine Mindstorms by untaring it into the Urbi engine runtime
folder. Follow instructions in INSTALL and README files

The file \file{TriBot.u} is loaded by default when server is launched. You
can remove it by modifying global.u.

\section{First steps with \urbi to control Mindstorms NXT}

This section is a short tutorial for using \urbi with the LEGO TriBot model with
the default configuration provided with the \urbi server. Users familiar with
\urbi should look directly to the next section for an extensive list of the
available devices.

\subsection{Make basic movements}

We will first move the wheels of the robot.

In \urbi, all the motor's speed and the sensor's value in a robot are associated
with variables. You can set the motor's speed or get the sensor's value by
assigning or reading the values of the corresponding variables.

In the default server layout for the TriBot model, the left wheel is assigned
to variable wheelL and the right wheel is assigned to wheelR\footnote{%
%%
  To be precise, sensors and motors are associated with objects. The left
  motor is associated with the wheelL object and the left motor speed is
  associated with the wheelL.speed slot of this object.
%%
}. The values of these variables control the corresponding wheel
speed. First put the TriBot upside-down to avoid any accident, then you can
move the left wheel just doing:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
wheelL.speed = 50;
\end{urbiunchecked}

Don't omit the semicolon at the end of the line, or the command will not be
executed. You can also move the right wheel (a negative value is a move
backward):
\begin{urbiunchecked}
wheelR.speed = -50;
\end{urbiunchecked}

A group is also defined so that you can give orders to several motors at the
same time. In our case, the group wheels contains both robot wheels. Setting
wheels to a value will set both wheels to this value:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
wheels.speed = 0;
\end{urbiunchecked}

will stop both wheels.
The third motor of the TriBot is associated with the claw variable.

\subsection{Improving the movements}
The commands given so far simply set a speed to the wheels, but you can use
\urbi to make precise sequences of movements. It is for example possible to set
a speed for a given time, then stop.

To achieve that, \urbi provides a command to wait for a given time: sleep
(duration). And you can make sequences of commands separated with semicolon
that will be executed one after another. So the following line:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
wheels.speed = 50;
sleep(10s);
wheels.speed = 0;
\end{urbiunchecked}

will make the robot to go forward during 10 seconds then stop.

It is also possible with \urbi to control the way the values will change. In the
previous examples, the motor speed goes from 0 to 50 as fast as possible. You
can use a modifier to the variable assignation to control the way the variable
value will change. For example, if you want to reach a value in a given time,
use the time: modifier:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
wheels.speed = 50 time:3s;
wheels.speed = 0 time:3s;
\end{urbiunchecked}

Using this code, the robot will accelerate to reach the speed of 50 after 3
seconds, then slow down to stop after another 3 seconds.
Other modifiers are available in \urbi, they are described in the \urbi tutorial
available at http://www.gostai.com/doc.php.

\subsection{Reading sensors}
In all the previous steps the commands don't take the environment into account.
To do that, you need to get the sensor values. In \urbi, you just have to type
the associated variable name. For example when you type:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
sonar.val;
\end{urbiunchecked}

The server returns a message with the ultrasonic sensor value:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
[00146711] 48
\end{urbiunchecked}

In this message, 146711 is the time (from the server clock) at which the value
was read, 48.00000 is the value of the sonar sensor, in this case the distance
to the obstacle in front of it.
You also need a way to react to the sensor values. In \urbi, this is achieved
using event catching commands. These commands check some condition and launch
other commands when these conditions are verified. For example the following
command:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
at (sonar.val < 50)
  wheels.speed = 0;
\end{urbiunchecked}

will stop the robot if an obstacle is detected at less than 50 centimeters.
Note that this command remains active in the server. If you move the robot and
set a forward speed:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
wheels.speed = 50;
\end{urbiunchecked}

the robot will stop again when another obstacle is encountered.
The other sensors available for the TriBot are the sound sensor decibel, the
bumper sensor bumper and the light sensor light. The following command:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
at (bumper.val == 1)
  wheels.speed = -50;
\end{urbiunchecked}

will make the robot go backward if something hits the bumper.
Note that the at command reacts only when the condition becomes true. If you
want to loop the execution of an action whenever the condition is true, use the
whenever command (see \autoref{sec:nxt:sounds}).


\subsection{Tagging commands}
The at commands you entered before are still active in the server. You need a
way to stop them if you want to do something else. The tagging mechanism will
enable you to do that.
A tag in a name associated to a command. To tag a command with the name mytag,
create it and simply prefix the command. For example:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
var mytag = Tag.new;
mytag: at (decibel.val > 0.7)
  wheels.speed = 0;
\end{urbiunchecked}

will launch the event catching command using the decibel sensor with tag mytag.
Later you will be able to stop that command:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
mytag.stop;
\end{urbiunchecked}

will stop the previous command and the robot will not react to sound anymore.
It if also possible to freeze temporarily a command:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
mytag.freeze;
\end{urbiunchecked}

will stop the commands tagged with mytag, but it will not be deleted, and
\begin{urbiunchecked}
mytag.unfreeze;
\end{urbiunchecked}

will resume the command.

\subsection{Playing sounds}
\label{sec:nxt:sounds}
The LEGO Mindstorms NXT is able to play sounds. The object beeper is associated
with this capacity. However, you can't just assign a value to the variable
beeper, because playing a sound requires several parameters. You therefore have
to call a method of the beeper object:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
beeper.play(200, 3s);
\end{urbiunchecked}

This will play a beep at 200Hz during 3 seconds (beep's frequency must be
between 200Hz and 14000Hz).
The parameters of the method may also be the result of operations, or depend on
other variables. For example, it is possible to play a sound which frequency
depends on the obstacle distance:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
var mytag = Tag.new;
mytag: whenever (sonar.val < 100)
  beeper.play(200 + 6 * sonar.val, 3ms);
\end{urbiunchecked}

This plays beeps with a lower frequency as the obstacle comes closer (under
1 meter).

\subsection{Cyclic moves}
We now introduce a modifier in \urbi that makes it possible to do cyclic
moves of sinusoidal shape. This modifier has the particularity to make the
assignation never terminate. To be able to enter new commands after this
modifier is used, you need to put this command in background so that the
\urbi server continues processing new commands. This is achieved by
terminating the command with a comma instead a semicolon. More details about
these command separators will be given in \autoref{sec:nxt:para}.  The sinus
modifier can be used this way:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
var mytag = Tag.new;
mytag: wheels.speed = 0 sin:10s ampli:100,
\end{urbiunchecked}

This command will make the speed of the wheels oscillate around 0, between -100
et 100 with a period of 10s. Use a tag to be able to stop the command. To make
the speed change from 0 to 100 with a period of 3 seconds, use the command:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
var tag2 = Tag.new;
tag2: wheels.speed = 50 sin:3s ampli:50,
\end{urbiunchecked}



\subsection{Parallelism}
\label{sec:nxt:para}
\urbi handles command parallelism in a very simple way. Parallelism is enforced
through various command separators:

\begin{itemize}
\item As usual in programming languages, two commands separated by a
  semicolon ";" will be executed one after the other:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
wheels.speed = 100;
sleep(2s);
wheels.speed = 0;
\end{urbiunchecked}

will turn the wheels, wait 2 seconds and then stop.

\item In \urbi, two commands separated by \lstinline|&| will be executed in
  parallel and will start exactly at the same time:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
wheelL.speed = 50 & wheelR.speed = -50;
\end{urbiunchecked}

will move at the same time the left wheel forward and the right wheel
backward (so the robot will turn).

\item The comma "," makes the first action to go in background and starts
  the next one as soon as possible, without enforcing a simultaneous start
  of the two commands:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
wheelL.speed = 50 time:10s,
wheelR.speed = -40 time:10s,
\end{urbiunchecked}

will not wait that wheelL grows to 50 to make wheelR decrease to -40, but
will not enforce that the commands terminate at the same time, which would
be the case with the \lstinline|&| separator.
\end{itemize}

This explain why the comma was necessary in the previous section. If we finish
a command that last forever with a semicolon, the server will wait forever
before starting a new command. If you happen to make this mistake, it is still
possible to open a new connection to the \urbi server using another client and
using the stop tag; command.

Here is an example where we use parallelism to move the TriBot awkwardly while
playing sounds:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
wheelR.speed = 0 sin:3s ampli:50 &
wheelL.speed = 0 sin:4s ampli:30 &
beeper.play(200,3s),
\end{urbiunchecked}

Parallelism handling is a key feature of \urbi, which has in fact four command
separators. See the \urbi tutorial available at http://www.gostai.com/doc.php
for more information.

\subsection{Using functions}
As in most programming language, it is possible to write functions in \urbi. The
functions are useful for making more complex programs where the same commands
are used several times.
The following example defines a function which moves the robot for a given time
at a given speed:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
function Global.forward(speed,timer)
{
  wheels.speed = speed;
  sleep(timer);
  wheels.speed = 0;
},
\end{urbiunchecked}


Once defined, this function can be called simply:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
Global.forward(100,3000);
\end{urbiunchecked}

More details about functions, objects and variables in \urbi are available in
the \urbi tutorial (http://www.gostai.com/doc.php).

\subsection{Loading files}
When making larger \urbi programs, it is easier to save them in files and to
command the server to load the files.
The files are simple text files in which you write \urbi commands. These files
should be saved in the data/ sub-directory of your sever directory. The files
should use the .u extension which is the extension used for \urbi script files.
An example demo.u is provided with the server. To make the \urbi server to
execute this script, type the \urbi command:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
  load("demo.u");
\end{urbiunchecked}


\subsection{Conclusion}
This chapter has highlighted the main features of \urbi with the Mindstorms
TriBot robot. The next chapter details all the devices available for the
TriBot in the default layout. For more details about the \urbi language,
please refer to the \urbi tutorial available at
\url{http://www.gostai.com/doc.php}.


\section{Default layout reference}

This chapter describes the objects defined in the \file{TriBot.u} layout
shipped with the \urbi Mindstorms NXT server.
\subsection{Motors}
Three motors are defined, wheelL, wheelR and claw.
A group, wheels, is defined to group wheelL and wheelR:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
wheels.speed = 10;
\end{urbiunchecked}

is equivalent to
\begin{urbiunchecked}
  wheelL.speed = 10 & wheelR.speed = 10;
\end{urbiunchecked}

The slot .speed allows you to set the current speed of the motor. This value
is set between -100 and 100.

Motor position (in degrees) can be accessed using the .val slot. This
slot is set to 0 when you turn the robot on.

\subsection{Sensors}
Sensors are grouped in the sensors group and all hardware devices (sensors +
motors + battery + beeper) are grouped in the hardware group.
\subsubsection{Bumper}
The switch device in front of the robot is called bumper. Its value is 1 if
it is pressed, 0 otherwise.
\subsubsection{Sonar}
The ultrasonic sensor is called sonar.  Its value is the distance measured
by the sensor in centimeters between 0 and 255. When the read operation
fails, 255 is returned.
\subsubsection{Decibel}
The sound sensor is called decibel.  Its value relates the level of ambient
sound. It is between 0 and 1.  Two different modes can be used by changing
the .mode slot to "DB" or "DBA".
\begin{description}
\item[DBA] is a mode measuring only frequencies between 200 and 14000Hz.
\item[DB] measures a wider band.
\end{description}
Default value is "DBA".

\subsubsection{Light}
The light sensor is called light.  The value returned is between 0 an 1
representing the amount of light measured.  Three different modes are
available by changing the .mode slot.
\begin{description}
\item[Reflector] means the sensor lights on its led and measures the light
  reflected.
\item[Ambient] lights off the led and measures the ambient light.
\item[Normal] lights off the led too and return the raw value measured.
\end{description}
Default value is "Reflector".

\subsection{Battery}
The battery device is called battery.  Its value is the current battery
level between 0 and 1, 1 is full charge.
\subsection{Beeper}
The beeper device is called beeper.  You can request the beeper to play a
sound using the play method:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
beeper.play(frequency, time);
\end{urbiunchecked}

frequency is an integer between 200 and 14000, which is the frequency of the
sound. time is an integer, which is the duration of the sound in milliseconds.
A duration of 0 is infinite.
The command returns immediately. If you want to wait until the end of the beep,
use:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
{
  beeper.play(frequency, duration);
  sleep(duration)
},
\end{urbiunchecked}

\subsection{Command}
The Command UObject is not a device. It makes it possible to send direct
commands as you do with the NXT SDK. You will find more information on http://
mindstorms.lego.com/
This object has methods to send and receive data to the NXT:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
Command.send(buff);
\end{urbiunchecked}
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item \var{buff} is a valid command buffer (list of integers between 0 and
  255).
\end{itemize}
For example:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
Command.send([3, 10, 10, 0 , 0]);
\end{urbiunchecked}
will play a beep.


\begin{urbiunchecked}
\var{answer} = Command.request(\var{buff}, \var{size}) ;
\end{urbiunchecked}

where:
\begin{itemize}
\item \var{buff} is a valid command buffer (requiring an answer)
\item \var{size} is the size of the return buffer (it must be the exact
  size)
\item \var{answer} is a list containing the values of the return buffer ([ ]
  is returned when the request failed)
\end{itemize}

This command is designed for expert users. Using it is not recommended if you
don't know what you are doing and might result in server crashes.
Here is an example:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
answer = Command.request([7,0], 15);
\end{urbiunchecked}

that returns the information on input port 1.

\section{How to make its own layout}

In this chapter, the method to build a custom layout for a different robot
is explained. A good understanding of the objects in \urbi in useful and the
reading of the \urbi tutorial is advised (available at
\url{http://www.gostai.com/doc.php}).

There are three kind of devices provided by the Mindstorms NXT server:
motors, sensors and other devices. There is one type of motor called
Servo. There is four types of sensors: Switch, SoundSensor, UltraSonicSensor
and LightSensor. Two other devices are available: Battery and Beeper. A
complete description of these devices is available in
\autoref{sec:nxt:specs}.  Writing a layout entails instancing particular
objects from the devices above.

\subsection{Instancing Motors}
The Servo init constructor has the following syntax:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
Servo.new(port);
\end{urbiunchecked}

where port is either "A", "B" or "C". The created object makes it possible
to control the motor connected to the port in parameter.  As an example, in
the current \file{TriBot.u}, three Servo objects are created:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
wheelL = Servo.new("C");
wheelR = Servo.new("A");
claw = Servo.new("B");
\end{urbiunchecked}

The wheel left is on port C, the wheel right on A and the claw is on port B.

\subsection{Instancing sensors}
To create a Switch object, the syntax is the following:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
Switch.new(port);
\end{urbiunchecked}

where port can be 1, 2, 3 or 4.

In \file{TriBot.u} the switch is used as a bumper plugged on the port 4 so
the instancing is:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
bumper  = Switch.new(4);
\end{urbiunchecked}

UltraSonicSensor objects are created the same way:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
UltraSonicSensor.new(\var{port});
\end{urbiunchecked}

\var{port} can be 1, 2, 3 or 4.

In \file{TriBot.u} an ultrasonic sensor is connected on port 2:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
sonar = UltraSonicSensor.new(2);
\end{urbiunchecked}

The SoundSensor object has an additional parameter:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
SoundSensor.new(\var{port}, \var{mode});
\end{urbiunchecked}

\var{port} can be 1, 2, 3 or 4.  \var{mode} sets the mode of the sensor. It
can be "DB" or "DBA", meaning "decibel" or "decibel adjusted" (the last one
records sounds in the frequency range 200-14000Hz).  In \file{TriBot.u}, the
sound sensor is on port 1 using decibel adjusted:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
decibel = SoundSensor.new(1,"DBA");
\end{urbiunchecked}

LightSensor also has two parameters:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
LightSensor.new(\var{port}, \var{mode});
\end{urbiunchecked}

\var{port} can be 1, 2, 3 or 4. \var{mode} sets the sensor mode and it can
be "Ambient" (so the sensor measures the ambient light), "Reflector" (the
sensor lights on its led and measures the reflected light) and "Normal" (the
sensor returns its raw value).

In \file{TriBot.u}, the light sensor is in reflector mode on port 1:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
light = LightSensor.new(3,"Reflector");
\end{urbiunchecked}


\subsection{Other devices}
The Battery device makes it possible to get the current battery level.
\begin{urbiunchecked}
Battery.new;
\end{urbiunchecked}

In \file{TriBot.u}:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
battery = Battery.new();
\end{urbiunchecked}

The Beeper device makes it possible to emit customized beeps from the NXT
speaker.
\begin{urbiunchecked}
Beeper.new();
\end{urbiunchecked}

In \file{TriBot.u}:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
beeper = Beeper.new();
\end{urbiunchecked}


\section{Available UObject Devices}

  create another device on it).

\item[init](<port>, <mode>) The UObject constructor. \var{port} is a port
  name. (See previous slot port). \var{mode} is a mode name. (See previous

  a custom duration.  \var{frequency} is the frequency of the beep (in Hz),
  between 200 and 14000.  \var{duration} is the duration of the beep (in
  seconds), 0 is infinite.  Example:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
beeper.play(200,1s);
\end{urbiunchecked}
\end{urbiscriptapi}

\subsection{Command}
\defObject{Command}

Command allows you to use expert commands. The Command UObject contains the
following methods:
\begin{urbiscriptapi}
\item[send](<buffer>) Sends a command without requiring any answer.
  \var{buffer} must be a list of integers between 0 and 255.  Example:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
Command.send([3,10,10,0,0]);
\end{urbiunchecked}

that plays a beep.

\item[request](<bufferIn>, <sizeOut>)%
  Sends a command requiring an answer, and returns the buffer out. This is
  only recommended to expert users. Beware of the \var{sizeOut}
  parameter. Indeed if it is too long, the request will normally fail and
  when the size is too short, the command may work but all Mindstorms
  internal buffers will be shift back (so this will bend all other
  requests).

  \var{bufferIn} is the buffer of the command. \var{sizeOut} is the size of
  the answer.

  Example:
\begin{urbiunchecked}
answer = Command.request([7,0], 15);
\end{urbiunchecked}

that returns the information on input port 0.
\end{urbiscriptapi}

\subsection{Instances}
Here are the different instances in the \file{TriBot.u} layout.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
  \hline
  Instance & UObject          & Description    \\
  \hline
