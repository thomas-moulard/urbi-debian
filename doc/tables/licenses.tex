  you will send to us via one of the email addresses of the Gostai employees

    assignment is or becomes invalid, ineffective or unenforceable, you
    hereby grant to us a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide,
    no-charge, royalty-free, unrestricted license to exercise all rights
    under those copyrights, including a license to use, reproduce, prepare
    derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform and

    these same rights to third parties through multiple levels of
    sublicensees or other licensing arrangements;

  \item you agree that each of us can do all things in relation to your
    contribution as if each of us were the sole owners, and if one of us
    makes a derivative work of your contribution, the one who makes the
    derivative work (or has it made) will be the sole owner of that
    derivative work;

  \item you agree that you will not assert any moral rights in your
    contribution against us, our licensees or transferees;

  \item you agree that we may register a copyright in your contribution and
    exercise all ownership rights associated with it; and

  \item you agree that neither of us has any duty to consult with, obtain
    the consent of, pay or render an accounting to the other for any use or
    distribution of your contribution.
  \end{itemize}

  payment to any third party, you hereby grant to us a perpetual,
  irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge, royalty-free license to:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise
    transfer your contribution in whole or in part, alone or in combination
    with or included in any product, work or materials arising out of the
    project to which your contribution was submitted, and

  \item at our option, to sublicense these same rights to third parties
    through multiple levels of sublicensees or other licensing arrangements.
  \end{itemize}

\item Except as set out above, you keep all right, title, and interest in
  your contribution. The rights that you grant to us under these terms are
  effective on the date you first submitted a contribution to us, even if
  your submission took place before the date you sign these terms.

\item With respect to your contribution, you represent that:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item it is an original work and that you can legally grant the rights set
    out in these terms;

  \item it does not to the best of your knowledge violate any third party's
    copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other intellectual property rights;
    and

  \item you are authorized to sign this contract on behalf of your company
    (if identified below).
  \end{itemize}

\item These terms will be governed in all respects by French laws and the
  French courts only shall have jurisdiction in relation to them.
